# Survey Intake App - Complete Build Guide

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Script: Introduction

Hey guys! I hope you are doing great. I will be building the survey intake application in this video. This project would let user create their account with email, verify their account, login, take a survey of detailed questions, submit it and then afterwards can view the submitted survey, edit it or even delete it as well. For admin they would be able to login with their admin email and would be able to see all users and all of their surveys they have took in detail. Some great to have features that I will include for users will be auto save of the survey form at any step and progress tracking of their survey form.

For the tech stack, I will be using React with TypeScript for type safety, Vite for lightning-fast development, Tailwind CSS for beautiful styling, and Supabase as our backend - which gives us a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features all in one package. I have chosen supabase as our backend because I will be able to show you a live demo after it is done, as in I will share a link where you would be able to use this project as a user or as an admin. I won't need to host a separate backend for APIs and database. I think for a small project like this where we need to just collect some user data and there are simple CRUD operations a good logical decision to use something that will make the product or project release super fast and at the same time reliable with less bugs as you are not coding up everything from scratch which would require maintinance, more work and susptible to more bugs. Non the less, to show you my backend nodejs work I will be creating an edge function hosting it on supabase which will be like a mock or simple version of the machine learning model API that would predict personâ€™s long-term care needs and costs.

Final note before we start with the development is that I have setup a few things ahead like table schema and some usual style or markup stuff just to make things a bit faster, this would only take more time and won't show you my actual development skills and approach.But I will be showing everything from start to finish, not skipping over things, or not recording so you could see every aspect of the development. I also have a plan file for different steps or phases of development where we could see the development process from a bit of top to get idea of where we are and where we are heading. Before taking more of your time let's get started.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup

First we will set up the main react app with vite

### Step 1: Initialize React Project

```bash
# Create new Vite project with React + TypeScript
npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts

# Navigate to project directory
cd survey-intake-app

# Install base dependencies
npm install

# Test basic setup
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS

Now we will set up tailwind in our react vite app for styling.

Create `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      maxWidth: {
        "var(--max-width)": "var(--max-width)",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Update `src/index.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
  --max-width: 1200px;
}

@layer components {
  .card {
    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    @apply px-4 py-2 bg-sky-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-sky-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-sky-500 focus:ring-offset-2 transition-colors;
  }

  .btn-ghost {
    @apply px-4 py-2 text-gray-600 hover:text-sky-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-sky-500 focus:ring-offset-2 transition-colors;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Install Additional Dependencies

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase 1 Summary:** finally for Project setup phase we will install some additional dependencies like react router for navigation, supabase client, and react hot toast for toats.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
npm install react-hot-toast
```

---

## Phase 2: Supabase Setup

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase Overview:** Now I will start to set up our backend with Supabase. This is where our data will live - we'll create our database tables, set up security policies, and configure our project.

---

### Step 4: Create Supabase Project

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** Let me first create supabase project.

### Step 5: Database Schema Setup

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Now let's create our database tables. We need tables for profiles, surveys, questions, submissions, and answers. I'll run this SQL script in the Supabase SQL editor to set up our complete schema."

```sql
-- Enable UUID extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- profiles table (users are managed by Supabase Auth)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  full_name TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- surveys table
CREATE TABLE surveys (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- questions table
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  survey_id UUID REFERENCES surveys(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ui_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
  question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  help_text TEXT,
  input_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (input_type IN ('text', 'number', 'date', 'select', 'radio', 'checkbox')),
  options JSONB, -- for select/radio/checkbox: [{"label":"Male","value":"male"},...]
  required BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  validation JSONB, -- e.g. {"min":0,"max":120,"pattern":"^[0-9]+$"}
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- submissions table
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  survey_id UUID REFERENCES surveys(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'in_progress' CHECK (status IN ('in_progress', 'completed')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- answers table
CREATE TABLE answers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  submission_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question_id UUID REFERENCES questions(id),
  answer_text TEXT, -- canonical single column for all answers
  answer_json JSONB, -- use when answer is structured (arrays/objects)
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- audit_logs table (optional)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  actor UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  object_type TEXT,
  object_id UUID,
  meta JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_survey_id ON questions(survey_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_ui_order ON questions(survey_id, ui_order);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_user_id ON submissions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_survey_id ON submissions(survey_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_answers_submission_id ON answers(submission_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_answers_question_id ON answers(question_id);
```

### Step 6: Row Level Security (RLS)

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Security is crucial for our app. I'm setting up Row Level Security policies so users can only access their own data, while admins can see everything. This ensures data privacy and security."

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE surveys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE questions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE answers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE audit_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Profiles policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Surveys policies (read-only for all authenticated users)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view surveys" ON surveys
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Questions policies (read-only for all authenticated users)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view questions" ON questions
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Submissions policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own submissions" ON submissions
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own submissions" ON submissions
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own submissions" ON submissions
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own submissions" ON submissions
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admin can view all submissions
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view all submissions" ON submissions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
      AND auth.users.email = 'waterlily-admin@yopmail.com'
    )
  );

-- Answers policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view answers for own submissions" ON answers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM submissions
      WHERE submissions.id = answers.submission_id
      AND submissions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert answers for own submissions" ON answers
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM submissions
      WHERE submissions.id = answers.submission_id
      AND submissions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update answers for own submissions" ON answers
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM submissions
      WHERE submissions.id = answers.submission_id
      AND submissions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete answers for own submissions" ON answers
  FOR DELETE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM submissions
      WHERE submissions.id = answers.submission_id
      AND submissions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Admin can view all answers
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view all answers" ON answers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
      AND auth.users.email = 'waterlily-admin@yopmail.com'
    )
  );

-- Audit logs policies (admin only)
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view audit logs" ON audit_logs
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
      AND auth.users.email = 'waterlily-admin@yopmail.com'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admin can insert audit logs" ON audit_logs
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
      AND auth.users.email = 'waterlily-admin@yopmail.com'
    )
  );
```

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase 2 Summary:** "Excellent! We've successfully set up our Supabase backend. We now have a complete database schema with proper relationships, security policies in place, and our project configured. Our data foundation is ready to support our application."

---

## Phase 3: Core Configuration

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase Overview:** Now we're connecting our frontend to our backend. We'll set up the Supabase client, define our TypeScript types for type safety, and configure our environment variables. This is where everything starts to come together.

---

### Step 7: Supabase Client Setup

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Let's create our Supabase client configuration. This will be the bridge between our React app and our Supabase backend. I'll create a client that we can import and use throughout our application."

### Step 9: Environment Configuration

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Security is important, so I'm setting up environment variables to store our Supabase credentials. This keeps sensitive data out of our code and makes our app ready for different environments."

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Create `.env.example` file:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

Update `vite.config.ts` to include environment variables:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  define: {
    global: "globalThis",
  },
});
```

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase 3 Summary:** "Perfect! We've successfully connected our frontend to our backend. We now have a configured Supabase client, comprehensive TypeScript types for type safety, and secure environment configuration. Our app is ready to start building features."

---

## Phase 4: Authentication System

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase Overview:** Now we're building our authentication system. This is where users will sign up, sign in, and we'll manage their roles. We'll create a custom hook to handle user state, protected routes, and beautiful sign-in/sign-up pages. This is the gateway to our application.

---

### Step 10: User Hook

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Let's create our user authentication hook. This will manage the current user's state, determine their role based on their email, and handle authentication changes throughout our app. It's the foundation of our user management system."

- Create `src/hooks/useUser.ts`

### Step 11: Protected Route Component

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Security is key, so I'm creating a protected route component that guards our sensitive pages. If someone tries to access a protected route without being logged in, they'll be redirected to the sign-in page."

- Create `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

### Step 12: Sign In Page

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Now let's build our sign-in page. This will have a clean form for email and password, handle loading states, and redirect users to different pages based on their role - admins go to the admin dashboard, regular users go to the survey."

- Create `src/pages/SignIn.tsx`

### Step 13: Sign Up Page

**ðŸŽ¬ Step Script:** "Finally, let's create our sign-up page. New users can register here, and we'll automatically create their profile in our database. After successful registration, they'll be redirected to start their survey journey."

- Create `src/pages/SignUp.tsx`

**ðŸŽ¬ Phase 4 Summary:** "Excellent! We've successfully built our complete authentication system. We now have user management with role-based access, protected routes for security, and beautiful sign-in/sign-up pages. Our app is secure and ready for users to start their journey."
